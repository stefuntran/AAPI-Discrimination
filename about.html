            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>Asian hate crimes in America has had a long history dating back to the first immigrants who came here, but has not been talked about as much as it is currently.The dramatic rise in Asian hate crimes has certainly to due with the COVID-19 pandemic as well as racial targeting by attackers. Poor word choices such as calling the COVID-19 the Kung Flu and Chinese Virus perpuate this idea of using Asian and specifically Chinese people, as the reason why the pandemic started. The attacks of verbal and physical violence has spread across America, including here at UCLA. If a Chinese student were to experience that here at UCLA, they would have to report to UCPD or some other official agency that is drawn out, might require them to identify themselves, and at worst, might not even recognize their incident as a discriminatory hate crime. This incident can feel isolating and overall powerless, so our website aims to change that. We want our users to feel connected with the community on here and feel empowered to share their stories with others. 
            </p>


            <h1>Future Plans</h1>
            <p>We would like our project to be used in the future or by the community members in a couple of different ways. First, we would like to share our website with student organizations and certain departments to do outreach that have connections to the Chinese community here at UCLA. Student organizations such as the Association of Chinese Americans, the Taiwanese Student Association, and the Asian Pacific Coalition for example will be organizations we want to hand our website to for them to distribute. They can share it with their members who have incidents but did not want to report them. Moreover, our website can be more accessible to people in the community by advertising it through social media and possibly in-person flyers. The informational flyers would have a QR code that would link to our website so it is accessible. This will allow users who are not a part of the groups mentioned earlier to be able to access it and also share it with other people. 


            The next plan is that we want to eventually use these personal stories and information on our website as a means to highlight the discrimination that is going on on our campus. Having this website will supplement the students' experiences that have been reported to the administration. We can also show this to the Asian American Studies department and gain their support in asking UCLA administration to recognize this as a problem which is the first step towards stopping more discrimination attacks and helping those who have been affected.
