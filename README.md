# AAPI-Discrimination

## What social problem is being addressed?

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
By creating a map of AAPI discrimmination based off of data that is sourced from the community, we amplify their voices and experiences. Sometimes, data that is gathered from large government groups often misrepresent data. With AAPI members as the main contributers to our mapplication, we are more confident that our map reflects their experiences.

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
One ethical problem that we may encouter with developing this tool relates to privacy concerns. Some individuals may not want this information to be shared on a public platform. A technical problem that we may encounter is explaining gaps that may appear in our dataset. For example, some individuals may leave out certain information because they are not comfortable with it.
