# Chinese-Discrimination

## What social problem is being addressed?
Chinese Americans have faced a long history of discrimination and hate in America.  Chinese discrimination rose when the pandemic started because there was a misconception that the Chinese community brought the virus to America. Through our project, we hope to address the hidden struggles that the Chinese community goes. We aim to do this by creating a mapplication that provides a platform for Chinese Americans to voice their frustrations about the discriminatin they face

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
By creating a map of Chinese UCLA students who have been discriminated based off of data that is sourced from the community, we amplify their voices and experiences. Sometimes, data that is gathered from large government groups often misrepresent data. With Chinese members as the main contributers to our mapplication, we are more confident that our map reflects their experiences.

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
One ethical problem that we may encouter with developing this tool relates to privacy concerns. Some individuals may not want this information to be shared on a public platform. A technical problem that we may encounter is explaining gaps that may appear in our dataset. For example, some individuals may leave out certain information because they are not comfortable with it.

## What technology is used by this project
In this project we are utilizing opensource software such as Papaparse (parser for csv) and Leaflet (to create our map). In addition, we used HTML, CSS and javascript in order to create our webpage. 


## How others can use this project in the future
Others can use this project in the future by accessing it through various ways such as a staff member from the Assosciation of Chinese Americans at UCLA sharing it to everyone in the club. Once they have access to the website itself, they can interact with our map and slideshow to read each individual's stories. Each story on the slideshow is connected to the points on the map which adds a narrative to the experience. The color design of the website reflects the user's expereince at UCLA. We hope through our design that users in the future will be able to visually see the experiences of others and be empowered to share their own story. In addition, the map that we have currently displays the stories shared by users as well as their perception of safety at UCLA. We hope that our map can be utilized
by the DailyBruin in an article that highlights discrimination at UCLA. That way, other students who
may not be Chinese can learn more about Chinese discrimination at UCLA.
