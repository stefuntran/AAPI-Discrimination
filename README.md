# Chinese-Discrimination

## What social problem is being addressed?
Chinese Americans have faced a long history of discrimination and hate in America.  Chinese discrimination rose when the pandemic started because there was a misconception that the Chinese community brought the virus to America. Through our project, we hope to address the hidden struggles that the Chinese community goes. We aim to do this by creating a mapplication that provides a platform for Chinese Americans to voice their frustrations about the discriminatin they face

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
By creating a map of Chinese UCLA students who have been discriminated based off of data that is sourced from the community, we amplify their voices and experiences. Sometimes, data that is gathered from large government groups often misrepresent data. With Chinese members as the main contributers to our mapplication, we are more confident that our map reflects their experiences.

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
One ethical problem that we may encouter with developing this tool relates to privacy concerns. Some individuals may not want this information to be shared on a public platform. A technical problem that we may encounter is explaining gaps that may appear in our dataset. For example, some individuals may leave out certain information because they are not comfortable with it.

## What technology is used by this project
In this project we are utilizing opensource software such as Papaparse (parser for csv) and Leaflet (to create our map). In addition, we used HTML, CSS and javascript in order to create our webpage. 


## How others can use this project in the future

This application is intended for the various organizations that exist at UCLA. These organizations could be given to Asian Pacific Coalition, which houses numerous Asian ethnic organizations under it, to disperse among them.One of them being Association of Chinese Americans (ACA) at UCLA.  The application can also be given to UCLA departments, especially the Asian American Studies Department, to share with their students or anyone interested in it. For the group of people who are not in those said organizations, the application will be passed onto a UCLA entity that can post this resource/information to their list. 

In the future, it will be open source so the community can use it to add any features they deem helpful in the future and for the fact that it will be available to use and edit if the current people who work on the map are not able to. We hope our project can allow people to visualize how COVID-19 plays a pivotal role in Chinese discrimination at UCLA which could possibly be used as a safe space for individuals to report incidents that happened to them without having to go through bureaucratic organizations such as UCPD and leave with the feeling that their story will be seen and read by everyone who visits the website. Additionally, viewing the application can demonstrate instances of discrimination happening and the possible steps that they can do to bring it to light and further action.
